# Tidal Spiral Visualization

This project generates generative art by visualizing tidal data as a moving spiral using Python and pygame.

## Features
- Loads or simulates tidal data
- Visualizes data as a dynamic spiral animation
- Built with pygame

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the visualization:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pygame
- numpy

## Usage
- The spiral will animate based on tidal data (real or simulated).
- Customize parameters in `main.py` as needed.
