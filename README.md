# sprial-kir
I used VSCode to generate an art project with the theme of visualizing tidal data, and successfully created a dynamic spiral graph through Python.

I completed the visualization of tidal data through vscode. The result displayed is a rich and colorful spiral visual dynamic graph, with the circles getting smaller from small to large, demonstrating the repetitive process of tides

Here are the gif picture when the code running ![tidal_spiral](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70349aa-2969-4594-a6d1-6f1a0ed34efb)
