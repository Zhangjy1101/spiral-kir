# sprial-kir
I used VSCode to generate an art project with the theme of visualizing tidal data, and successfully created a dynamic spiral graph through Python.

I completed the visualization of tidal data through vscode. The result displayed is a rich and colorful spiral visual dynamic graph, with the circles getting smaller from small to large, demonstrating the repetitive process of tides

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
